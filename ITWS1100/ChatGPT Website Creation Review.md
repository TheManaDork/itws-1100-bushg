Step 1: CSS optimization.
First I asked ChatGPT to optimize the CSS of my website, which, with the exception of my resume page, all use one CSS file. ChatGPT was able to shorten my file by 5 lines, and found multiple spots where my code could be simplified, all while maintaining my code's functionality perfectly.
ChatGPT was able to successfully follow the broad instruction to "Help me improve my personal website," and also responded well when I asked it to explain some of it's changes.

Step 1.5:
It also responded well to the command "make the buttons in the nav-bar respond to being hovered," and although the hover effect is reminiscent of modern web design rather than my website's slightly more retro aesthetic, that is only to be expected when I didn't specify aesthetic.

Step 2:
My resume page uses it's own css separate from the rest of my website and lacking in any ability to navigate to the rest of my website, so my second major change was to have ChatGPT add one. This took a whole conversation as even after I explained my situation and goals and provided the relevant code, ChatGPT failed to properly account for my resume's css, resulting in the html elements being horribly displaced, and ultimately I made some of my own changes rather than try to get the bot to do it itself.

Step 3:
For change 3 I had ChatGPT give me metadata for my index.html's head blocks. This change went the worst yet for a few reasons. Firstly, each file needed slightly different information and ChatGPT didn't do a good job of accounting for that. Second off, ChatGPT tried to intuit too much. Making up information such as the contents of my labs, titles, descriptions, and even social media information when I did not provide that. As a result, ChatGPT provided me with way too many metadata tags, much of which were useless.

Step 4:
Step 4 had ChatGPT working to standardize my websites spacing using variables. Other than needing to specify that I didn't actually want my spacing changed, just standardized using variables, it went quite well. This sort of tedious search and replace is something ChatGPT excels with.

Step 5:
For step 5 I tested ChatGPT's creativity by asking it to "...add some extravagant feature...." to my code. It gave me several options, and after not enjoying the option to make some of my site's images float - it looked terrible, just a bad option - I added a tips feature to my homepage. Which is cute. Although it is very separate from the vibe of my page, it works well as a fifth change for that reason - very simple to implement - along with being creative and a useful way to provide extra information and personality to my website.
