I modeled my website off of rpi's homepage, blatantly stealing their primary red because red is my favorite color, as well as their large navigation bar, which I am rather a fan of.

I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to aesthetically fill space, but eventually I figured out that cat pictures can do almost all of that work for me, and I, luckily, am quite the cat person.


Also in case you are confused, the difference between this late submission, and my first on time submission, is that that first submission was missing this readme file and was incorrectly named.
