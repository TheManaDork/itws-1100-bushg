I modeled my website off of rpi's homepage, blatantly stealing their primary red because red is my favorite color, as well as their large navigation bar, which I am rather a fan of.

Working link to my website (when azure is running it ofc):

LAB8: To see what I implemented for the suggestion that we "*jazz-up*" our website, try clicking the various cat photos.


LAB10: You will find I have setup automated production, fixed navigation links to be relative, cleaned up image sizes, added more index.html's for labs that were previously missing them, and generally cleaned up my code. I removed many unused files, as well as my quizzes folder, and secured resources, lab1, lab6, and lab9.
