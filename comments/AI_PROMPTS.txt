1.
Prompt:
(code to print table of database vals from lab 9)
(Having previously given it my database setup)
Change this code so it prints the data like a comments section.
Notes:
Worked quite well, also giving me some css which is what is in the <style> tags of status.php

2.
Prompt:
(code of index.php)
Find the syntax error
Notes:
I hadn't included jQuery, and didn't realize that the PHP validation code that was given for lab 9 uses it.

3.
Prompt:
(Code for printing the database)
Reverse the order of the comment output
Notes:
Output wasn't changing for some reason, turned out I had a syntax error in my sql query.
