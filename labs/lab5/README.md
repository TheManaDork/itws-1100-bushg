# ITWS LAB 5

Had a fun time using string math and a document-wide on-click event to mimic the effect of the placeholder attribute
Having a heck of a time making the responce form resizeable. I'll ask some of my more experienced friends for help, but
luckily for me it is not a necessary part of the lab. Really a bit mistified.
Worked out quite nicely regardless. The default html fits my 'retro' website nicely enough.
Otherwise no notes. Had fun with this one.
