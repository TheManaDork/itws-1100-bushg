# ITWS1100 - Lab 2

Notes:
I did not put an enormous amount of forethought into my color pallette choices,
and are definitely going to be reworked as I expand my website.

The polka-dots on my name-link also don't look that great and remain in more due to the amount of work
put into creating them than anything else. It amuses me though so I'll remember the option for the future.

Otherwise I am quite happy with how it turned out. 'justify-content: space-between' is definitely the hero of my resume and one of the few parts that I had no trouble implementing.
