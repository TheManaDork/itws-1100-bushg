        <h3>From here you can access all of my labs from the nav bar! I realize this likely won't scale well as we hit double digits of labs, and I will find a way to make this or something else work, however right now I like this scheme too much to preemptively stray from my website's default layout.</h3>
        <h3>Anyways, here you can access the files for the various labs I will be completing for my 'Intro To Information Technology and Web Science' class at RPI. It is worth noting that as many of these will involve this website you can also see the results, at least, from other parts of my website such as my resume, aka lab2, which is accessible from the homepage.</h3>
        <h3>P.S. "<-Intro to ITWS", on the left of the nav bar, is a button to return to the homepage. I believe this is sufficiently obvious but I'm not 100%.</h3>
