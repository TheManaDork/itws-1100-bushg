This lab introduces us to xml, as well as news feeds as an actual practice rather than metaphor.
This will be very useful for a variety of potential applications we may find ourselves working on in the future.

My feed is simple and functional, naming, describing, and categorizing updates to my website. Just labs for the time being however I hope to add other tags in the future.
