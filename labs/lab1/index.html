        <h1>LAB ONE</h1>
        <h3>This lab is actually the foundations of this very website! In this lab we set up Azure, the hosting service which is probably what is allowing you to see this website on your computer! Along with that we also set up github repositories for our website and connected the two. Not to mention set up some basic security features.</h3>
        <h3>Not much else to put here, no code or anything, but if you'd like to see the files I used to verify I completed this lab you can download them below!</h3>
